%(statement)%	Each row of suits represents a set of cards in a bag. Pretend that you close your eyes and reach into each of the bags. Please answer the question that goes along with each bag.	Each row of veggies represents a bag of frozen veggies. Pretend that you close your eyes and reach into each of the bags. Please answer the question that goes along with each bag.	Each row of desserts represents a choice of available desserts in a dessert display case. Pretend that you close your eyes and reach into each of the dessert cases. Please answer the question that goes along with each case.	Each row represents cards with the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI in a pile. Imagine you close your eyes and choose cards from the pile.	Each row represents fast food sitting on a tray. Imagine you close your eyes and take an item off of the tray.	Each row of balls represents different balls in a sports bag. Pretend you close your eyes and reach into each bag.	"Your friend prepared 6 bags where each contains chess pieces you see below. Each bag has a label for the piece you are suppose to take out with your eyes closed. If the piece you pick out matches the label, you win! Calculate the probability of winning for each bags."
